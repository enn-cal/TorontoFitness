# TorontoFitness

Fullstack web application for Toronto Fitness, where users can log in or register, and create an account. 
Users can find gym studios based on geographical proximity to their current location, 
from a pinpoint on a map, or a postal code. Studios can be filtered by name, 
amenities, class names, and coaches that hold classes in those studios. 
Users can also search/filter a studio's class schedule based on name (e.g. Yoga), 
coach name, date, and time range. 
Users can also subscribe to a subscription plan to book classes, and have automatic 
payments at the beginning of the period to their cards, and view their past and future
payments.
